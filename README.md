# AI Commit
AI Commit is a command-line tool that streamlines your Git workflow by using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to generate commit messages for your Git commits. Have you ever spent too much time thinking of the perfect commit message that accurately describes your changes? AI Commit eliminates that problem by providing you with a range of quality commit message options in seconds, so you can spend more time coding and less time writing commit messages.

## Prerequisites
Before installing AI Commit, you will need to generate your OpenAI API key. If you haven't already done this, you can follow the steps in this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nafDyRsVnXU) to get your key.

You will also need to have pip installed. To check if you have pip installed, open a terminal window and run the following command:
```sh
pip --version
```
If you see a version number in the output, it means that pip is installed. If not, you can install pip by following the following command:
```sh
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
Verify that pip has been installed correctly by running:
```sh
pip --version
```

You should get something like:
```sh
user@User:~$ pip --version
pip 20.0.2 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip (python 3.8)
user@User:~$
```
## Installation
To install AI Commit, please follow the steps below:
1. Clone the AI Commit repository to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:
```sh
git clone 
```
